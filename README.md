1 Introduction

The ‚ÄúMonte Carlo Method‚Äù is a method of solving problems using statistics. Given the probability, p, that an event will occur in certain conditions, a computer can be used to generate those conditions repeatedly. The number of times the event occurs divided by the number of times the conditions are generated should be approximately equal to p.

Figure 1 shows a circle with radius r = 1 inscribed within a square. The area of the circle is œÄr2 = œÄ12 = œÄ, and the area of the square is (2r)2 = 22 = 4. The ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square

isœÅ= Areaofcircle =œÄ4 =0.7853981634.GivenœÅthenœÄ=œÅ√ó4. Area of square

If we could compute ratio œÅ, then we could multiple it by four to obtain the value œÄ. One particularly simple way to compute œÅ is to pick random points in the square and count how many of them lie inside the circle (see Figure2).

Suppose for example that the points Ùè∞ã 2i‚àí1 , 2j‚àí1 Ùè∞å32, 32 are selected, 32 32 i=1,j=1

then there are 812 points inside the circle and 212 points outside the cir- cle. The percentage of points inside the circle is œÅ = 812 = 812 =

0.792195122. Then the area of the circle is approximated with the fol- lowing calculation: œÄ = Area of circle = œÅ √ó Area of square = œÅ √ó 4 = 0.792195122 √ó 4 = 3, 168780488.

2 Monte Carlo Method for œÄ

Monte Carlo methods can be thought of as statistical simulation methods that utilize a sequence of random numbers to perform the simulation. The name ‚ÄúMonte Carlo‚Äù was coined by Nicholas Constantine Metropolis (1915-1999) and inspired by Stanislaw Ulam (1909-1986), because of the similarity of statistical simulation to games of chance, and because Monte Carlo is a center for gambling and games of chance. In a typical process, one computes the number of points in a set A that lies inside box R. The ratio of the number of points that fall inside A to the total number of points tried is equal to the ratio of the two areas (or volume in 3 dimensions). The accuracy of the ratio p depends on the number of points used, with more points leading to a more accurate value.

A simple Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the value of œÄ could in-

volve randomly selecting points (xi, yi)ni=1 in the unit square and determining

the ratio œÅ = mn where m is number of points that satisfy x2i + yi2 ‚â§ 1. In

a typical simulation of sample size n = 1000 there are 787 points satisfy-

ing that equation. Using this data we obtain œÅ = m = 787 = 0.787 and n 1000

œÄ = p √ó 4 = 0.787 √ó 4 = 3.148.

Every time a Monte Carlo simulation is made using the same sample size n, it will come up with a slightly different value. The values converge very slowly of the order O(n‚àí1/2). This property is a consequence of the Central Limit Theorem.

You may find a web simulation of this method at https://academo. org/demos/estimating-pi-monte-carlo/.

3 Lab Work

3.1 Sequential Version

Design and implement a Java program named approxPi that approximates the value of œÄ by using the Monte Carlo method. The program must receive a command-line argument that specifies the number of simulations to be executed (i.e., the number of points to be generated) and provide an output as given in the example below. Try multiple values for the number of simulations, e.g.,

<pre>$ approxPi 1000
Total Number of points: 1000
Points within circle: 779
Pi estimation: 3.11600
</pre>
<pre>$ approxPi 100000
Total Number of points: 100000
Points within the circle: 78656
Pi estimation: 3.14624
</pre>
You may have an estimation of the time your program takes to run the full simulation by using the command time, e.g.,

Use this simple lab exercise to learn how to use GIT. Create a repository in a free public server (e.g., github, gitlab, bitbucket, . . . ) and use it to manage the versioning of your code.

3.2 Parallel Version

Now, create a branch named ‚Äúparalell‚Äù and develop a parallel version using Java-threads. This parallel version must accept a second argument indicating how many parallel threads will be executing. If the second argument is omitted, it defaults to one.

Remember to keep on using GIT. üôÇ

3.3 To Think About. . .

The sequential version is faster, slower, or identical to the parallel version with just one thread?

The parallel version with two threads is faster than with one? When you double the number of threads does it take half the time? More? Less?

Final Note

If you search the web, it will be trivial to find an implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the value of œÄ, which you can easily adapt to your needs. But note that if you do that, you are cheating and you will not learn what you are supposed to learn in this lab class. Just be honest with yourself and make your own program. üòâ
